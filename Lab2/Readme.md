This project follows the Xilinx ISE 10.1 In‑Depth Tutorial to design, simulate, and extend digital circuits using schematic-based design in the ISE CAD environment. All work is completed inside a provided Windows XP virtual machine with Xilinx ISE 10.1 installed, as this version supports the NetFPGA hardware.
The assignment includes building and simulating several digital components without using IP cores, including a synchronous 8‑bit adder, a 32‑bit adder, and a full 32‑bit ALU. All schematics, simulations, and mapping results are generated using the ISE tools.
